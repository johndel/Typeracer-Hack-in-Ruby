# Typeracer hack in ruby (windows only)

### Description
This is just a fun project I made to check how I could control keyboard from a ruby script in windows. If you are from Greece, check this <a href="http://greeksolution.gr/blog/keyboard-simulation-with-ruby/">typerace ruby hack tutorial</a>.

### Usage
1. Visit typeracer and enter in a race
2. With firebug or with any other similar browser plugin, copy the text that you have to write into the input box, and paste it between the heredoc (between the keywords HERE)
3. Type `ruby typehack.rb` to the command line and then focus on the input of the site where you should have started to write
4. After two seconds it will start to write the text!

### Just for Fun
I did it only for fun and test! Don't abuse it, I love <a href="http://www.typeracer.com">typeracer</a>, I just wanted to try out how I could write more than 100 words that
I usually do and if there is a limit. Here a picture:<br />

### Future
Well in the typeracer if you type more than 100 words per minute you will need to prove that you are not a bot...! So I might try to create an OCR. Another idea is to create something
similar with selenium which I also like very much.

_I'd love to hear your comments about. Thank you!_
